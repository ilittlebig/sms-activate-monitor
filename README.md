## Introduction
This application is a serverless Discord bot designed to monitor the availability of GMX numbers on the SMS-Activate platform. Upon detecting changes in availability, the bot sends real-time alerts to designated Discord channels. The solution leverages AWS Lambda for serverless execution and is fully automated using Terraform for infrastructure management.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously checks the availability of GMX numbers on SMS-Activate.
- **Instant Notifications**: Sends immediate alerts to specified Discord channels upon detecting changes.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Utilizes AWS Lambda to ensure scalability and cost-effectiveness.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Employs Terraform for consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployment.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Allows users to set custom thresholds for stock change notifications.

## Architecture Overview
The SMS-Activate Monitor is built upon a serverless architecture, primarily utilizing AWS services:
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes the botâ€™s code in response to events.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Serves as the HTTP endpoint for Discord interactions.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Stores configuration data for each Discord guild.
- **AWS CloudWatch Events**: Triggers the Lambda function at regular intervals for monitoring tasks.
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Securely stores sensitive information such as API keys and tokens.

The infrastructure is defined and managed using Terraform, ensuring a consistent and reproducible deployment process.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the SMS-Activate Monitor, ensure you have the following:
- **AWS Account**: Access to an AWS account with permissions to create the necessary resources.
- **Discord Application**: A registered Discord application with a bot token. You can create one through the Discord Developer Portal.
- **SMS-Activate API Key**: An active API key from SMS-Activate.
- **Terraform**: Installed on your local machine. Follow the official installation guide if needed.
- **Python 3.9**: Ensure Python 3.9 is installed, as the Lambda function is built for this runtime.

## Installation
**1. Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ilittlebig/sms-activate-monitor.git
  cd sms-activate-monitor
  ```

**2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment:**
  ```bash
  python3.9 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

**3. Install Python Dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r discord_bot/requirements.txt
  ```

**4. Initialize Terraform:**
  From the root directory:
  ```bash
  make init
  ```

## Configuration
**1. Environment Variables:**
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:
```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=your_discord_application_id
SMS_ACTIVATE_API_KEY=your_sms_activate_api_key
DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY=your_discord_public_key
LOCAL_TESTING=true
```

**2. Terraform Variables:**
Update the `infra/variables.tf` file with appropriate values for your environment. Ensure that the `aws_region` and other variables are set correctly.

## Deployment
**1. Run the Application Locally:**
Once youâ€™ve verified the application locally, prepare it for deployment by running:
```
make local-run
```
This command will set up and run the application in your local environment, allowing you to test and ensure everything functions as expected before deployment.

**2. Package the Application for Deployment:**
From the root directory:
```
make package
```
This command will create the necessary deployment package, typically a ZIP file containing your application code and dependencies, ready to be uploaded to AWS Lambda

**3. Deploy with Terraform:**
From the root directory:
```bash
make deploy
```
This command will utilize Terraform to provision the required AWS resources and deploy your packaged application.

**4. Register Discord Commands:**
After deploying the application, initialize the botâ€™s commands by running:
```bash
python3.9 discord_bot/register_commands.py
```
This script registers the botâ€™s commands with Discord, making them available for use in your server. Ensure that this step is performed after the deployment process to finalize the botâ€™s setup.

## Usage
Once deployed, the bot will automatically monitor GMX number availability on SMS-Activate and send alerts to the configured Discord channels. You can interact with the bot using the following commands:

### Commands
- `/monitor [country]`: Set the country to monitor for GMX number availability.
- `/setchannel [channel]`: Designate the Discord channel for receiving alerts.
- `/setthreshold [threshold]`: Define the minimum stock increase required to trigger an alert.

> **Note**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use these commands. Typically, only users with administrative privileges can configure the bot.

### Monitoring and Logging
The application leverages AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring. To view logs:
1. Navigate to the `AWS CloudWatch Console`.
2. Select Logs from the sidebar.
3. Locate the log group associated with your Lambda function (e.g., `/aws/lambda/discord_bot`).

Here, you can monitor the botâ€™s activity and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

Security Considerations
- **API Keys and Tokens**: Store all sensitive information securely using AWS Secrets Manager. Avoid hardcoding credentials in your codebase.
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Assign the least privilege necessary to AWS IAM roles and policies associated with the Lambda function.
- **Discord Permissions**: Ensure the bot has appropriate permissions within your Discord server to function correctly.
